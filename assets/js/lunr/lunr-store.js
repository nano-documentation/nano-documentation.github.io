Driver requirements   In order to work with Nvidia GPUs nanominer needs Nvidia driver 410.48 and newer on Linux or 411.31 and newer on Windows. nanominer cuda11 version needs Nvidia driver 455.23 and newer on Linux or 456.38 and newer on Windows. Nvidia 30xx series of GPUs will only work with cuda11 version of miner.   In order to begin mining Ethereum with nanominer, it’s enough to simply input your wallet in the configuration file.   Testing on nanominer demonstrated high performance working with Ethereum, Ravencoin, Ethereum Classic, Conflux, QuarkChain, Ubiq, Monero, Cortex, Ergo and other currencies. Ethash, Etchash and KawPow implementations have some know-how optimizations for DAG size in memory which is critical for 3 GB and 4 GB GPUs. Independently of this, nanominer stands out with its high stability and simple setup.   Reporting bugs and technical support  For reporting bugs, technical support, feature requests and community discussions feel free to use the following communication channels:     Support email: support@nanominer.org   GitHub issues tracker: https://github.com/nanopool/nanominer/issues   Community chat in telegram (developers read it too): https://t.me/nanominer_en   Our Discord channel https://discord.gg/JtKHCbm8Yg   Setup  At launch nanominer reads the config.ini setup file from the program’s current directory. In order to assign a specific name to the config file, it should be written as the first argument in the command line. For example:  nanominer.exe config_etc.ini  When launching with the -d command line option (e.g. nanominer.exe -d) the miner displays a list of the devices it detects, including their PCI addresses and their amount of memory. In order to use this function on Windows the program must be launched from the command prompt (cmd).   nanominer does not require any pools to be specified in the config file. If a pool (or list of pools) is not specified, nanominer will automatically use the pools on nanopool.org corresponding to the chosen cryptocurrency (except for coins not listed on Nanopool). QuarkChain public full nodes (fullnode.quarkchain.io and fullnode2.quarkchain.io) which are maintained by QuarkChain developers are used by default for QuarkChain.   When nanominer starts up it displays the main work information in the console log, including the program’s current version, the name of the rig, the number and type of graphics cards installed and the program’s current settings.  Log Files  The event log function on nanominer is automatically activated each time the program starts up. The log files that are created contain all the information displayed on the console while the miner is running. By default, the log files are saved in the logs folder of the program’s current directory. Deactivating event logging, as well as assigning a random catalogue for recording log files, can be done by using the corresponding configuration parameters (see the examples in the Parameters section of this file).   Remote Monitoring  nanominer has web interface for getting rig statistics, discovering other instances of nanominer in the local network and managing them. You can edit miners’ config via web as well as restart the miners. In order to perform these actions on a running instance of nanominer, its config must contain a password for web interface (see the webPassword option). By default nanominer starts a HTTP server on port 9090, which can be found on http://127.0.0.1:9090. In the program’s config file, the port can be configured and the API function can be deactived with the webPort option (or it can be set to 0 to disable web interface). BoringAPI for getting rig statistics is supported aswell, which can be found on http://127.0.0.1:9090/stats.   nanominer also supports the network API program EthMan for rig monitoring. By default it opens port 3333 in “read-only” mode without the ability to restart the miner or rig through the network. In the program’s config file, the port can be configured and the API function can be deactived with the mport function. The config file also lets you set a password for monitoring with the ethmanPassword option.   Automatic Restart Function  With default settings, nanominer will automatically restart if it encounters critical errors in the GPU or lag. (These errors usually arise due to hardware problems or overclocking the GPU.) The automatic restart function can be deactivated using the watchdog parameter.   Likewise, the minHashrate (minimum hashrate) parameter allows the user to set the value of the minimum hashrate which, if exceeded, will cause the miner to restart. This function uses the average hashrate over the last ten minutes, as displayed in blue in the console log. If the average hashrate over 10 minutes is lower than the set value, the miner will restart. With default settings the minimum hashrate is not set.   Another function on nanominer that improves the miner’s automatic functioning is handled by the restarts parameter.It sets the number of times the miner restarts before rebooting the worker (rig). By default the miner will only restart itself.   More detailed information on using these functions can be found in the Parameters section of this file.   Parameters  The settings for nanominer can be found in the configuration file with the *.ini extension (config.ini by default). Config file can contain common params and algorithm params (in sections with corresponding algorithm names). Section names can be defined as “Ethash”, “Etchash”, “KawPow”, “Octopus”, “Ubqhash”, “RandomX”, “Verushash”, “Autolykos” or “Zilliqa”. Configuration file must be in the following format:  commonparameter1=commonvalue1 commonparameter2=commonvalue2 commonparameterX=commonvalueX  [AlgoName1] devices=0,1 wallet = wallet1 algoparameter1=algovalue1_1 algoparameter2=algovalue1_2 algoparameterY=algovalue1_Y  [AlgoName2] devices=2,3 wallet = wallet2 algoparameter1=algovalue2_1 algoparameter2=algovalue2_2 algoparameterZ=algovalue2_Z  [AlgoName3] devices=4,5 wallet = wallet3  More config examples can be found below.   This file permits the presence of empty lines and comments. Comment lines should begin with a “;” (semicolon). The parameters and values are not case-sensitive, which means it makes no difference to the program whether you type ETH, eth or Eth, or whether you type wallet or Wallet. If an incorrect value is set for a parameter, the default value will be used instead (note that this rule does not apply to the wallet parameter).   What follows is a list of the parameters that can be set on nanominer.  wallet  Mandatory parameter. This is the user’s wallet, where funds will be deposited.  coin  Optional parameter. This chooses the default coin for the pool. The default pool is nanopool.org. The coin parameter accepts one of the following values: ETH (or Ethereum), ETC (or Ethereum Classic), RVN (or Raven), CFX (or Conflux), QKC (or QuarkChain), UBQ (or Ubiq), XMR (or Monero), CTXC (or Cortex), VRSC (or Verus), ERG (or Ergo), VTC (or Vertcoin), ZIL (or Zilliqa). When a coin is specified and equals one of the values mentioned above, nanominer automatically tries to determine the pool necessary for it to function if none have been provided in a separate parameter. If a coin is specified but nanominer cannot recognize it, then the name of the coin is used only for logging. If a coin is not specified, nanominer will use the default coin for the corresponding algorithm. Moreover, if nanopool.org is specified in the configuration file for Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ergo or Monero, nanominer will determine the coin from the pool’s settings.   Important: when using nanominer to mine Ethereum Classic on the default pool, it is necessary to define the coin (coin=ETC). In that case the pools will be determined automatically.   If the pools are clearly defined with the aid of the pool1, pool2, …, parameters, then nanominer will function according to the tasks it receives from those pools.  rigName  Optional parameter. Can be specified in common parameter section instead of the algorithm section to be applied for all algorithms at once. This is the name of the rig (computer/worker). It will be displayed in the pool’s statistics. If this parameter is not set, the program will generate a unique name and provide it to the pool. To disable rigname completely just set it to empty string with  rigName=  email  Optional parameter. Can be specified in common parameter section instead of the algorithm section to be applied for all algorithms at once. This is the user’s e-mail address. It is provided to the pool where the rig will be operating. The pool can use it when sending out service notifications.  pool1, pool2, …  Optional parameter. This defines the set of mining pools used. Values must be given in the format url:port (e.g. pool1=eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999). The parameters should be defined in ascending, sequential order, from pool1 to poolN (for example: pool1, pool2, pool3). If the pool list is provided, the best pool will be chosen from the order of the pool list. If a sortPools=true option is specified, the best pool will be chosen by the connection speed. If the pool (or list of pools) is not defined, nanominer will automatically use the pools on nanopool.org that correspond to the chosen cryptocurrency. For QuarkChain public full nodes are used if no pools are defined. For Ubiq Ubiqpool.io pools are used if no pools are defined.   protocol  Optional parameter. Can be used to set the pool protocol to stratum. If not specified, nanominer will try to detect the pool protocol automatically.   rigPassword  Optional parameter. The password for the rig (or worker). It may be necessary when working with pools that require registration and setting a rig password.  watchdog  Optional parameter. This parameter manages the miner’s restart function when running into critical GPU errors or lag. It accepts the values true or false. By default, true – automatic restart – is activated.  restarts  Optional parameter. This parameter sets the number of times the miner will restart before rebooting the rig. In case of GPU problems like hardware errors or lag, or in case of hashrate degradation (if the minhashrate option is used), nanominer will restart. However, certain errors cannot be fixed by restarting the program. In such cases it is necessary to reboot the rig. To reboot, the miner loads the reboot.bat script from the current directory if running on Windows or reboot.sh if on Linux:  reboot  The reboot.sh file on Linux must be given execute permissions in order for it to work. The typical content of the reboot.bat script for Windows:  shutdown /r /t 5 /f  The script must be written by the user. To run reboot script instead of restarting miner every time a critical error occurs, just set restarts=0   minHashrate  Optional parameter. This is the minimum acceptable hashrate. This function keeps track of the rig’s total hashrate and compares it with this parameter. If five minutes after the miner is launched the set minimum is not reached, nanominer will automatically restart. Likewise, the miner will restart if for any reason the average hashrate over a ten-minute period falls below the set value. This value can be set with an optional modifier letter that represents a thousand for kilohash or a million for megahash per second. For example, setting the value to 100 megahashes per second can be written as 100M, 100.0M, 100m, 100000k, 100000K or 100000000. If this parameter is not defined, the miner will not restart (with the exception of the situations described in the watchdog section). Restarts caused by this option count towards the restarts parameter.  maxRejectedShares  Optional paramter. Can be used to set the maximum amount of rejected shares before restarting miner process/rebooting the rig. Restarts caused by this option count towards the restarts parameter. Option is disabled by default.  devices  Optional paramter. These are the graphics cards that will be used by the miner. If you do not want to launch the miner on all available GPUs but only on some of them, their numbers can be provided in the devices parameter separated by a comma or space. nanominer numbers the GPUs starting from zero in ascending order of their PCI addresses. You can see a list of available GPUs and the order in which they’re in by launching nanominer with the -d command line option:  nanominer -d  For example, if there are four GPUs in the system (0, 1, 2, 3) and all but the second-to-last one (indexed as 2) must be set to mine, then the devices option must be set in the following manner:  devices=0,1,3  The order of devices determines the order of displayed hashrate. For example, if it is set as  devices=3,1,0  then the hashrate line will first display GPU3, then GPU1 and finally GPU0.   checkForUpdates  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is true). If this parameter is set to false then nanominer stops checking for the newest release version on every startup.   autoUpdate  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is false). If this parameter is set to true and checking for updates is enabled, then nanominer will update itself on every startup, provided there is a newer version available.   coreClocks, memClocks  Optional parameters. Can be used to overclock/underclock NVIDIA GPU’s. Absolute (e.g. 4200) as well as relative (e.g. +200, -150) values in MHz are accepted. Parameter values must be separated by a comma or space (first value is for GPU0, second is for GPU1, and so on). For example, if it is set as  coreClocks=+200,-150 memClocks=+300,3900  then GPU0 will be overclocked by 200 MHz of core and 300 MHz of memory, whereas GPU1 core clock will be underclocked by 150 MHz, and its memory clock set to 3900 MHz. You can also apply same settings for each GPU by defining only one core and memory clock value, for example:  coreClocks=+200 memClocks=+300   powerLimits  Optional parameter. Can be used to set Nvidia cards power limits from -50 to 50. For example, -20 means 80% power limit, 10 means 110% power limit. Parameter values must be separated by a comma or space (first value is for GPU0, second is for GPU1, and so on). You can also apply same settings for each GPU by defining only one power limit value.   memTweak  Optional parameter. Can be set to modify AMD GPU timings on the fly for Ethash/Etchash/Ubqhash algorithms. The following AMD ASICs are currently supported: gfx900, gfx901, gfx906, gfx907, Baffin, Ellesmere, gfx804, Hawaii, Tahiti, Pitcairn, Tonga.   Miner must be launched using admin/root privileges in order to change timings.   Default memory tweak value is 1 which means slightly improving memory timings. Zero value means timings are left as is without modifications. Parameter values must be separated by a comma or space (first value is for GPU0, second is for GPU1, and so on). Supported memory tweak value range is from 0 to 10 (0 means disabling timings modification, 1 is the least intense, 10 is the most intense), for example:  memTweak=9,8,10  It is recommended to begin from lower values and increase them if the miner works stably.   You can also apply same settings for each GPU by defining only one memory tweak value:  memTweak=10   fanSpeed  Optional parameter. Used to set the GPU fan speed to a specific percentage from 30% to 100%. If below 30, automatically sets to 30. If the value is incorrect, i.e. negative or non-numeric value, sets to the last used value.   epoch  Optional parameter. Ethash algorithm specific option to check miner behaviour on different Ethash epochs.   zilEpoch  Optional parameter. Sets the epoch of Zilliqa DAG to store in GPU memory (default is 0).   noLog  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is false). If this parameter is set to true then no log files will be recorded onto the hard drive.   noColor  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is false). If this parameter is set to true then the console output won’t contain any colors.   logPath  Optional parameter. This parameter can either be used to set the name of the folder in which log files will be created (e.g. logPath=logfolder/), or to specify a path to single file, which will be used for all logs (e.g. logPath=logs/log.txt, logPath=/var/log/nanominer/log.txt, logPath=C:\\logs\\log.txt). Both relative and absolute paths work. Default value for this parameter is logs/.   webPassword  Optional parameter. Password for web interface. There is no password by default (web interface is read-only).   webPort  Optional parameter. Port for web interface. The default port is 9090. Zero value disables web interface.   mport  Optional parameter. This is the network port for remote monitoring and program management through EthMan or other programs that use a similar API protocol format. The program supports all API functions, including restarting the miner and rig(s). You can block miner management through API (in which case the miner will only display the statistics and won’t respond to any commands). To enable this function, a “minus” (-) sign must be written before the port number. And you can completely deactivate remote monitoring. To do this, the port number must be set to “0” (zero). Default value: -3333 (This means that the miner blocks management through API and displays statistics on port 3333).   ethmanPassword  Optional parameter. Your password for monitoring with EthMan and other utilities that support the same network API.   useSSL  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is true). If this parameter is set to true then miner always tries to use SSL pool connection first and fallbacks to unencrypted connection if SSL connection failed. If this parameter is set to false then miner doesn’t try using SSL for pool connection.   shardId  Optional parameter. Can be used to set a shard ID for QuarkChain solo mining. This parameter should be specified in hex, e.g. 0x1, 0x10001, 0x10002, 0x50001, etc. For root chain shard ID null must be specified. For more information on shards, visit this and this link. Default shard ID is 0x1. Shard ID is passed to QuarkChain node “as is” so all current and future Ethash shards are supported.   farmRecheck  Optional parameter. The interval (in milliseconds) between polling the node for new jobs in solo mining mode for QuarkChain. Default value is 200.   cpuThreads  Optional parameter for CPU mining. Specifies the number of concurrent CPU threads to use for mining. All threads are used by default.   sortPools  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is false). If this parameter is set to true then the best pool will be chosen by least ping (not by the pool list).   countDevShares  Optional parameter. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is false for QuarkChain solo mining and true for other coins). If this parameter is set to true then shares accepted or rejected by pool during fee time will be included in miner statistics. Otherwise only shares during user mining are included to miner statistics.   sendHashrate  Optional parameter for Ethash, Etchash and Ubqhash algorithms. This parameter accepts the values true or false. The default value is true (if JSON-RPC pool protocol is used).   dagSer  Optional parameter for Ethash, Etchash and KawPow algorithms. This parameter accepts the values true or false (the default is false). If this parameter is set to true then the DAG will be generated sequentially on each GPU. Otherwise all the GPUs generate DAG at the same time.   Configuration File  The minimum configuration file for Ethereum may contain only a wallet:  wallet=&lt;wallet&gt;  nanominer will automatically use Ethereum pools.   To work with Ethereum Classic, the coin must be specified:  wallet=&lt;wallet&gt; coin=ETC  In this case nanominer will use pools corresponding to Ethereum Classic.   IMPORTANT!  For coins that are not supported by nanopool.org, you must specify a wallet and pools (pool1…).   Launching from command line  It is possible to run nanominer from the command line with the desired arguments. At least one algorithm and wallet are required to be passed. All common config parameters in the command line must be specified before the first “algo” parameter. Here are some examples of command lines for launching Ethereum and Monero:   Windows:  nanominer.exe -algo ethash -wallet YOUR_ETH_WALLET -coin eth -rigName YOUR_ETH_WORKER -email YOUR_EMAIL -algo randomx -wallet YOUR_XMR_WALLET -coin xmr -rigName YOUR_XMR_WORKER -email YOUR_EMAIL   Linux:  ./nanominer -algo ethash -wallet YOUR_ETH_WALLET -coin eth -rigName YOUR_ETH_WORKER -email YOUR_EMAIL -algo randomx -wallet YOUR_XMR_WALLET -coin xmr -rigName YOUR_XMR_WORKER -email YOUR_EMAIL    If no algo specified, ethash is used by default. So the following commands will launch the ethash algorithm:   Windows:  nanominer.exe -wallet YOUR_WALLET  Linux:  ./nanominer -wallet YOUR_WALLET   The helper scripts folder with all of its contents is still there, for those who use it.

        "excerpt":"You can use this list as a reference for all Launch Parameters supported by Nanominer.    Download   Download Now   How to use    \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t    To start Ethash, enter at the .ini file:   [Ethash] wallet=0x123... coin=ETH   Fill your ETH address in the “wallet” line and this is petty much enough to start mining Ethereum with Nanominer on Nanopool.   The easiest way to get a wallet is to register on a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance or Huobi.   The next steps are not necessary but if you have more than one RIG, it would be much more convenient if you set a different name for each so that you’ll be able to track them on the pool individually.   You are also advised to set your email address in if you want to receive alerts form the pool when your worker (RIG) goes offline. You email will also be your password to access the settings. If you don’t want to receive the alerts, you can use a passphrase instead. As it’s not mandatory, feel free to jump down to the next step.      Add rigName= line under the wallet to indicate your RIG name   Add email= line to indicate your email/passphrase   NOTE: Nanominer will connect to the pool’s default server, and It might be not the best choice for you as there’s latency and you want the server you connect to to be as closer to your location as possible. Therefore, by adding the follower parameter at the bottom of your Nanominer’s config.ini file:   sortPools=true this will enable automatic pool’s servers sorting based on their ping speed   You can be sure that Nanominer will automatically pick the server that has the lowest ping time from your location and the network latency will not affect your mining as the pool and the miner will communicate at the highest speed possible. Full Configuration Example:   [Ethash] wallet=0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5 coin=ETH rigName=Rig001 email=example@email.com sortPools=true   Start the Miner   Start the miner by running the nanominer.exe file. Nanominer will start, run the commands to set those environment variables, initialize each of your GPU’s, build the DAG file on each of your GPU’s and start hashing away. After a while, you’ll be able to find your account on the pool.   Find your Account on Nanopool   Remember there’s no registration on the pool. You just need to start mining and your account will automatically show up. However, allow some time as our system needs about 30 minutes to add your account to the pool’s database since your miner submitted its first share. So please, be patient and come back to Nanopool in a while, there’s Address  filed on the right top in which you need to fill your Ethereum address in. Once filled, hit enter, you’ll be redirected to your Nanopool account page.   Congrats! You have joined Nanopool. Spend some time to familiarize yourself with the pool and its features; you’ll like the interface.   Customize Nanominer for maximum profit! Read the full guide to configuring Nanominer   How to disable GPU   If you do not want to launch the miner on all available GPUs but only on some of them, their numbers can be provided in the devices parameter separated by a comma or space. nanominer numbers the GPUs starting from zero in ascending order of their PCI addresses. You can see a list of available GPUs and the order in which they’re in by launching nanominer with the -d command line option:   nanominer -d   For example, if there are four GPUs in the system (0, 1, 2, 3) and all but the second-to-last one (indexed as 2) must be set to mine, then the devices option must be set in the following manner:   devices=0,1,3   The order of devices determines the order of displayed hashrate. For example, if it is set as:   devices=3,1,0   Then the hashrate line will first display GPU3, then GPU1 and finally GPU0.   Example of configuration file for mining Ethereum, Monero, Ubiq and PascalCoin on same 8 GPUs rig using separate devices:   rigName = rig1 [Ethash] wallet = 0xada842613541e55e2500478892a334cde74ff653 devices = 0,1 [Etchash] wallet = 0xada842613541e55e2500478892a334cde74ff653 devices = 5 [Ubqhash] wallet = 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111 pool1 = ubiq-eu.maxhash.org:8008 devices = 2,3,4,6,7 [RandomX] wallet=84XFxjQVYoJjQBeyfbcYBgJ1tw4cgywGyTp12nQw3mSKZctgMYuPGRH1y2LuBAS8yyT8ZX2NDS3CXbfFAxdXQJwAGMoMDSq   LHR   Optional parameter for Ethash and Etchash algorithms. Can be used to set desired percentage of full unlocked hashrate. Valid range is from 50 to 100. Also can be set to off (-1) or auto (0). Use off for non-LHR cards and auto for automatic LHR card detection and tuning. Default is auto. This parameter can be set for each GPU separately. In this case, order must correspond to the order of GPUs, specified in devices parameter. For example:   devices=0,2,3 lhr=71.5,off,0          LHR Partial Unlock with Nanomienr and NBMiner (3060, 3070 Ti, 3080 Ti Tested)  In this video I walk through and test the latest version of NBMiner which promises an up to 70% unlock of the full Ethereum Hashrate of Nvidia LHR GPUs.
